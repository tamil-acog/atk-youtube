<h1 class="h1Element"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMXfZB8FVUA&t=0.03s">hi everybody welcome to a new tutorial series</a></h1>

<div class="divElement">
<p class="pElement">In this series, we are going to learn how to work with PI torch. High torch is one of the most popular machine learning and deep learning frameworks. It's really fun to work with and develop cool applications. So, I hope you watch the series and learn all about the necessary basics for this framework.</p>
<p class="pElement">So, in this first video, I will show you how to install PI torch. Let's start. For this, we go to the official website, PI torch org. Then, click on "get started" and select the newest PI touch build.</p>

use the GPU version then you can select it here and then click on the copy button to copy the command and paste it into your terminal and hit enter and then it will start installing PI torch.

<h1 class="h1Element"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMXfZB8FVUA&t=37.05s">select your operating system</a></h1>

<div class="divElement">
<p class="pElement">Right now, this is version 1.3. Then, select your operating system. In my case, it's a Mac. Then, select the package manager with which you want to install PI torch. I highly recommend using anaconda. If you haven't installed anaconda yet and don't know how to use it, then please watch my other tutorial about anaconda. I will put the link in the description below. Then, select the newest python version. Here, I select python 3.7. Unfortunately, on the Mac, you can only install the CPU version right now. But, if you are on Linux or Windows and want to use the GPU version, then you can select it here. Then, click on the copy button to copy the command and paste it into your terminal and hit enter. And then, it will start installing PI torch.</p>

the python version so I want to use python 3.7 so let's add this here and now let's activate this environment with Conda activate pie torch and now we can install pie torch with pip install torch and now we have pie torch installed in our virtual environment and we can start using it for our machine learning projects. 

<h1 class="h1Element"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMXfZB8FVUA&t=83.79s">install the cuda toolkit</a></h1>

<div class="divElement">
<p class="pElement">To have GPU support, you need to install the CUDA toolkit first. The CUDA toolkit is a development environment for creating high-performance, cheap, GPU-accelerated applications. To install it, you need an NVIDIA GPU in your machine. If you have that, you can go to the website developer.nvidia.com/CUDA-downloads. </p>
<p class="pElement">Be careful, because the newest supported CUDA version by PyTorch is CUDA 10.1. So, you have to get this version. Right now, the newest version is 10.2. So, you have to go to legacy releases, then select the newest CUDA toolkit 10.1, and then select your operating system. For example, Windows 10. Download the installer and follow the instructions. This will also check if your system is suitable for the CUDA toolkit. </p>
<p class="pElement">If this is successful, then we can go back to the PyTorch site and copy this command. In my case, on the Mac, I need this command. Let's copy this and now let's open up a terminal. First of all, we want to create a virtual environment with Conda in which we want to install all of our packages and install PyTorch. Let's create an environment, let's say Conda create -N, and now give it a name. So, I call this PyTorch, simply PyTorch, and then also specify the Python version. So, let's add this here. Now, let's activate this environment with Conda activate PyTorch, and now we can install PyTorch with pip install torch. Now, we have PyTorch installed in our virtual environment, and we can start using it for our machine learning projects.</p>

<h1 class="h1Element"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMXfZB8FVUA&t=201.45s">this will create your virtual environment with python 3</a></h1>

<div class="divElement">
<p class="pElement">The Python version, let's say python equals 3.7, and then hit enter. Now, this will create your virtual environment with python 3.7. Let's hit enter again to proceed. This will take a while and now it's done. Now, we can activate this environment with Conda activate PI torch. We are inside of this environment and we can see this because here in the beginning we have PI touch in parentheses. This is the name of the environment. Now, let's paste our installation command from the website. This will install pi torch and all the necessary packages. This will also take a couple of seconds. Again, let's hit enter to proceed and now it's done. Now, we have installed PI torch and we can verify that by starting Python inside this environment. Let's say no type Python and enter. Now, we have Python running and now we can import the torch module. If the installation was not correct, right now you would get a...</p>
