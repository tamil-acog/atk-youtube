Design Workflow', '\n\n', 'the the particular application in', 'question', "and I think it's sort of useful to start", 'by thinking about sort of what is the', 'workflow of protein design and you know', 'here in the baker lab I think we start', 'often with a sort of structure first', 'approach to protein design where largely', 'we follow these kind of four steps and', 'these are the four steps that you kind', 'of need to fulfill to successfully', 'design a protein and we start with sort', 'of the generation of a backbone so a', 'structure that we believe is capable of', 'carrying out some particular function', 'whether that be binding to another', 'protein or perhaps holding an active', 'site or something of an enzyme and then', 'once we have these backbones we then', 'derive a sequence or try and find a', 'sequence that can fold up to that', 'backbone structure so we actually find', "the sequence after we've designed the", 'backbone and typically we can generate', 'many more sequences and structures', "computationally than we're able or want", 'to test uh experimentally so therefore', 'we need sort of good computational', 'filters and metrics that we trust to be', 'able to narrow down our set of designs', 'to a set that we can and experimentally', 'characterize and validate as you know', '\n\n\n', 'Backbone generation is the limiting factor', '\n\n', 'working experimentally', 'and', 'you know what I just want to point out', 'is that with the Advent of ML and its', "application to protein design there's", 'really been sort of enormous advance in', 'these uh latter three stages or steps of', 'protein design you know protein npn is', 'this phenomenally good neural network', 'for fixed backbone sequence design so', 'given a protein backbone find a sequence', 'that folds to that and then with the', 'development of alpha fold 2 and Rosetta', 'fold and other structuring prediction', 'networks we now have these just amazing', 'tools for really rapidly validating that', 'our design sequences do indeed fold up', 'to our design structures so you know', 'once we have a sequence we can just put', 'it into one of these structure', 'prediction networks and ask does it fold', 'up to the same structure that we', 'designed and we have really extensive', 'evidence now showing that you know if', 'you can get really good recapitulation', 'by for instance Alpha fold then your', 'chance of experimental success on a', 'whole range of different problems is', 'really high', 'um and then finally I just want to point', "out there's also been significant", 'development in in experimental', 'characterization of designs such that we', 'can now go from sort of like a design', 'problem or designs on a computer to', 'validated proteins in around a week on', 'the scale of sort of 96 to 384 well 384', 'proteins so you know we can basically if', 'we can crack this problem of backbone', 'generation then you know the workflow', 'Downstream of that for a whole range of', 'different problems in protein design is', 'really well characterized down', 'and therefore you know given the', 'backbone generation for a whole host of', 'problems is the kind of the bottleneck', 'in protein design we set out to try and', 'develop new deep learning based methods', '\n\n\n', 'Probabilistic diffusion models excel at image generation', '\n\n', 'for Designing protein backbones', 'and for this we turned to this sort of', 'now reasonably well established area of', 'uh ml uh this area of probabilistic', 'diffusion models and these have been uh', 'sort of shown to achieve', 'state-of-the-art performance in image', 'generation and the kind of basic', 'principle of diffusion models um is sort', 'of something like what is depicted here', 'so typically you start with images or', 'known data so true data true images in', 'this case a dog and then over a set', 'number of time steps you add sort of', 'increasing amounts of noise so you know', 'through a repeated application of noise', 'your image or starting data becomes', 'noisier and noisier so sort of', 'intermediate time steps you have these', 'sort of very grainy images that still', 'clearly bear some resemblance to your', 'starting image but eventually your sort', 'of final time step you reach some', 'distribution which Bears no dependence', 'on your starting image so you know', "you've basically erased all of the", 'information in that starting image', 'and importantly the structure of the', 'noise that you add at each time step is', 'known this is typically gaussian noise', 'of a known variant and through repeated', 'application of uh gaussian noise you', 'basically converge to a known', 'distribution so you know through', 'application of many gaussians you reach', 'an actual gaussian distribution', 'typically indistinguishable from like', 'just a unit gaussian', 'and then given that you have this sort', 'of noising schedule you then train a', 'neural network to basically undo this', 'noise so give them some slightly noisy', 'image say you know x t plus one here you', 'train a neural network to undo one step', 'of noise so to get you back to XT in', 'this case', 'and the beauty of this is that if you', 'can successfully train these models then', 'you can now sample from your known', 'distribution so your gaussian', 'distribution in this case and you can', 'then just feed Pure Noise into your', 'model and through sort of repeated steps', 'of denoising you eventually reach a', 'distribution which closely matches the', 'distribution that you trained on so in', 'other words you can start you can feed', 'in Pure Noise into your model and get', 'out images in this case which look', 'really similar to the images that you uh', '\n\n\n', 'Diffusion models as an attractive framework for protei design', '\n\n', 'trained your model on', 'and the reason we sort of wanted to', 'train a diffusion model on proteins uh', "was that you know they're just a really", 'uh natural fit for protein design and', "that's sort of three sort of main", 'reasons I think so you know firstly they', 'can generate some basically endlessly', 'diverse outputs because in that', "generation process you're feeding in", 'Pure Noise so completely random noise', 'and actually then each step of denoising', "you're also adding more random noise", 'that you know basically every trajectory', 'or every generation is novel and', 'different and therefore you can sample', 'uh really diverse space of solutions and', 'this is good for protein design where we', 'want to sort of uh you know extensively', 'sample the space of possible solutions', 'uh secondly at least in the way that we', 'formulated this diffusion model we can', 'operate directly on amino acid', "coordinates so if we're building protein", "backbones we're actually physically", 'operating on the backbone coordinates', 'and this is really beneficial for some', "of the applications that we'll discuss", 'later in the talk', 'and then finally uh in the image', "literature they've been shown to be able", 'to condition on a really wide range of', 'inputs and they can also be guided with', 'sort of external auxiliary potentials so', 'you know you can basically have a model', 'that can condition on really high', 'resolution features such as the', 'structure of a functional Motif or', 'something but also one sort of more sort', 'of coarse grained uh you know make me an', 'approximate fold kind of information and', 'then you can also guide this generation', 'so this is useful in a design setting so', 'you know these kind of three things led', 'us to really sort of motivated us to', 'train a diffusion model on protein', 'backgrounds', 'so you know it kind of looks similar to', 'that image I showed you of uh diffusion', "of images uh but now we're starting from", 'real protein structures and then we', 'iteratively add noise or corrupt these', 'structures until we reach some known', 'distribution so in our case a 3D', 'gaussian distribution and then we train', 'a neural network to assess essentially', 'undo that noise such that we can Now', 'sample from that known 3D gaussian', '\n\n\n', 'How can we learn on protein structures?', '\n\n', 'distribution feed that into our model', 'and uh generate new protein structures', 'but you know trading on protein', "backbones is challenging it's more", 'challenging or it presents new', 'challenges as compared to uh training on', 'images you know protein backbones have', 'these uh really strong constraints', 'backbones comprise these four heavy', 'atoms the NCL for the C and the oxygen', "uh they're connected by three covalent", 'bonds and obviously you have to be able', 'to form a continuous chain to make a', 'protein backbone', 'um also then your backbone has to have a', 'sequence that can encode it so uh you', 'know not all backbones are encodable by', 'an amino acid sequence so you know there', 'are real challenges in training a', 'diffusion model on protein structures', 'and therefore we kind of thought about', 'what is the best way to represent', 'protein backbones and the simplest way', 'to try and train a generative model on', 'them you know you could think maybe you', 'could just represent everything as atoms', 'but this is kind of complicated so um', 'instead we sort of turned to uh the the', 'way in which backbone residues are', 'represented in both Alpha fold and', 'Rosetta fold which is this frame-based', 'representation', 'so this sort of takes advantage of the', 'fact that the geometry of the NC Alpha', 'and C Alpha c bonds in protein backbones', 'is highly constrained highly fixed and', 'the oxygen can then actually be derived', 'the position of the oxygen could be', 'derived from the position of these sort', 'of NC Alpha C frames so in other words', 'we can basically treat this MCL for c as', 'a triangle as a frame which is then', 'described purely by a translation and a', 'rotation so we simplify these protein', 'structures these complex protein', 'structures now just into a set of like L', 'translations and rotations where L is', 'the length of the protein here so this', 'is like a really efficient and simple', 'way of representing protein backbones', 'and then the other challenge in uh sort', 'of uh training a diffusion model on', "backbones is that now you're operating", "in three dimensions and you're as I said", 'you know these frames are represented by', 'translation and a rotation and therefore', 'we need to noise both of those', 'modalities so when we add noise to our', 'protein structures we have to be able to', 'noise both the position so the', 'translation of these frames but also the', 'the orientation of these frames so', 'specifically what we do is that we apply', 'just 3D gaussian noise to the C Alpha', 'coordinates the translation position', 'and then the rotations uh we basically', 'diffuse these we apply a Brownian motion', 'on the manifold of rotation matrices so', 'this is uh known as SO3 and this is', 'basically yes like Brownian motion on a', 'sphere you can think of it as and that', 'sort of looks like uh this movie shown', 'on the right where you start off with', 'these sort of neat little triangles and', 'then gradually these become sort of', 'noisier and noisier their noise both in', 'their translational and rotational uh', 'component', 'and then the goal is once we have this', 'forward noising process we train a', 'neural network to try and remove this', 'noise so to reverse this process', 'and just one final thing', 'um I need to sort of describe before we', 'get into the guts of RF diffusion is', 'this really nice property of diffusion', 'models which really motivated the', 'approach that we took here so you know', 'when we think about diffusion models we', 'often think about sort of uh this', 'reverse generative process as being sort', 'of removing one step of noise at a time', "but actually there's this really nice", 'property that at least up to this', "scaling Factor there's an equivalent", 'between whether you predict just one', 'step of noise so predict how to remove', 'one step of noise or whether you', 'actually just directly predict the', 'ground truth image or protein structure', "so you know it's it's equivalent up to", 'the scaling factor to just um predict', 'the ground truth protein structure and', 'then back calculate the next time step', 'or to uh predict just one step of noise', '\n\n\n', 'Formulating RoseTTAFold as the denoising network', '\n\n', 'and this equivalent is really nice', 'because this then motivated the approach', 'that we took', 'so our specific approach was to take a', 'structured prediction Network so Rosetta', 'fold in our case and then fine-tune it', 'to be the denoising network in a', 'diffusion model', 'and we sort of theorized that this would', 'be a good idea because the architecture', 'of Rosetta fold already sort of in some', 'ways resembles that which would be', 'required for a denoising network it has', 'se3 equivariants', 'um it then also you know it takes these', 'input sequences and input coordinates', 'and predicts ground truth protein', "structures it's trying to predict the", 'true protein structure and therefore we', 'thought well you know this architecture', 'and the inductive bias of a structure', 'prediction Network should really help us', 'or act as a you know fantastic basis to', 'be fine-tuned into a generative model', 'which we call RF diffusion so in RF', 'diffusion we take this rosette fault', 'architecture and the pre-framed rosette', 'fault waves and now we fine-tune it on', 'this generative task so what we do is', 'that rather than providing input', 'sequences we now just mask that so you', "know there's no or sometimes a small", "amount but you know it's essentially", 'just masked input sequence and then', 'those noised input coordinates so uh you', 'know that forward noising that we can', 'apply we can then just feed these in as', 'coordinate inputs into Rosetta fold and', 'then we just ask rosette fold given', 'those two inputs to predict a', 'ground-proof structure which we call X', 'naught hat in this case so you can kind', 'of see that this sort of architecture', 'closely matches uh that of rosette fold', 'and we therefore theorize that this', '\n\n\n', 'Training Summary', '\n\n', 'would be an efficient way of uh training', 'a generative model of protein backbones', "so I won't go into all of the kind of", "training details but I'll just discuss", 'some sort of high-level features of the', 'the training strategy of rf2 fusion so', 'we train our diffusion on the protein', 'Data Bank we train on basically most of', 'the protein Data Bank we limit ourselves', 'to proteins less than 384 amino acids so', "we don't crop proteins at all and these", 'are just clustered by sequence', 'similarity', 'um then you know I mentioned that in', "diffusion models you're applying noise", 'over a set number of time steps in RX', 'Fusion this is 200 time steps', 'um and this basically gets you to a', 'purely random 3D gaussian distribution', 'of the alpha coordinates and their', 'uniform distribution of your rotations', 'this then trains for a reasonably modest', 'amount of compute really this trains on', 'eight a100s for about four days so given', 'that this model is like about 80 million', 'parameters this is pretty efficient uh', 'for trading you know such a big model', 'and then the two sort of key things that', "I'll just go into a little bit more", 'detail on are this concept of', 'self-conditioning and then sort of this', 'concept of fine-tuning from a structured', 'prediction Network', '\n\n\n', "Allowing the model to 'self-condition' improves RF diffusion", '\n\n', 'so on this first point this', 'self-conditioning this was really', 'motivated by two things so firstly this', 'was motivated by work in other diffusion', 'literature which shows that uh or showed', 'that basically giving a model access to', 'its its prediction at the previous time', 'step can help it make its next', 'prediction and this is kind of', 'conceptually similar to the concept of', 'recycling in both Alpha fold and Rosetta', 'fold where you give the structure', 'prediction Network multiple goes at', 'making its structure prediction each', 'time conditioned on its last uh', 'prediction so we kind of theorized that', 'we might be able to leverage this in RF', 'diffusion so specifically what we do is', 'that we take the X naught hat prediction', 'from a Time step and then we feed that', 'in to the model during its next time', 'step so you know XT plus one we generate', 'an X naught hat which we then feed into', 'the model along with the coordinate', 'input at time step T and then the model', 'can leverage both the position of the', 'coordinates at the current time step and', 'what it thought that the ground truth', 'structure intervals at the previous time', 'step to make its next prediction and', 'this really markedly improves RF', "diffusion so we're going to show you", 'just a few plots that look like this', 'throughout this talk and basically this', 'is just benchmarking the performance of', 'RF diffusion on a sort of mixed', 'Benchmark set so this is split both into', 'unconditional Generations so can you', 'just make any protein and then these', 'functional Motif scaffolding problems so', 'can you build the scaffold to support a', "particular bit of protein and we'll go", 'into more detail about this later in the', 'talk but basically you know what we do', 'is that we generate backbones we find', 'sequences with protein npnn and then we', 'Alpha fold them and we ask how closely', 'does alpha fold recapitulate our designs', 'so in these plots the rmsd between Alpha', 'fold and design you know the lower the', "better that's the closer the", 'recapitulation and we also look at Alpha', 'fold confidence how confident Alpha fold', 'is in its prediction this is the', 'predicted alignment error lower is', 'better in both cases', 'so what you can see here is that when we', 'allow RF diffusion to self-condition so', 'to see what it predicted at previous', 'time steps', 'um it really markedly improves the', 'performance so you can see on', "unconditional generation uh we're", 'getting much better recapitulation by', 'Alpha fold and also generally in uh', 'functional Motif scaffolding we also get', '\n\n\n', 'Training from pre-trained RoseTTAFold weights make training computationally tractable', '\n\n', 'better recapitulation and Alpha fold is', 'also more confident in this prediction', 'then you know I mentioned that I sort of', 'a whole approach was to fine-tune a', 'structure prediction Network to find', 'directly leverage the sort of inductive', 'bias of a structure prediction Network', 'to be the basis of a diffusion model and', 'this was indeed a kind of good idea I', 'suppose so we did as a control try', 'training RF diffusion from untrained', 'weights so we just initialized randomly', 'initialized weights in uh rosette fold', 'and or diffusion and train it for an', 'equivalent amount of compute and you can', 'see that in an equivalent amount of', 'compute you really are not very good at', 'all so that showed in dark gray here', "across these tasks uh you're really much", 'much worse than if you fine-tune from', 'pre-trained rosetteford wins and it just', 'sort of really Hammer home the point if', 'you just run protein npn on gaussian', 'noise you basically achieve sort of a', 'not much worse performance so you know', 'this we are directly able to leverage', 'this inductive bias in Rosette fold to', '\n\n\n', 'RF diffusion, with pre-training and self-conditioning, generates good designs', '\n\n', 'fine-tune a generative model', 'and then this is just a depiction of', 'what proteins coming out of our Earth', 'diffusion look like under these', 'different conditions so this is like the', 'median sample by rmsd of the alpha volt', 'model and you can see that without', 'pre-training the model really struggles', 'to learn in this amount of compute at', 'least uh the task at all so the outputs', "just don't really look like proteins at", "all when you don't when you have", "pre-training but you don't do", 'self-conditioning you can kind of see', 'that these proteins resemble proteins', 'you know they have secondary structure', "but they're just not well packed and", "they're not particularly diverse but", 'when we do self-conditioning and we', 'start from pre-trained rosette fold', 'waves we get this these just really nice', 'structures so this is the median 300', "amino acid sample you can see that it's", '\n\n\n', 'Tackling unsolved problems with RF diffusion', '\n\n', "well packed it's like mixed topology and", 'looks uh very nice', "so I'll now hand over to David who will", 'tell you about the experiment that we', 'did characterizing our active fusion', 'um and yeah', 'excellent', "yeah so so now that Joe's kind of", 'introduced', 'the thought process that went into the', 'development of the model and sort of how', 'we started the Benchmark it in silico', 'when we started to see these like pretty', 'good in silico Benchmark results it was', 'now kind of time to to test this out on', 'and test real proteins and', 'experimentally verify the proteins that', 'this model is making and so we tested', 'experimentally uh designs from a variety', 'of problems which we considered as kind', 'of limited in backbone generation and so', 'problems where if if we had good', 'backbone generation we could we could', 'have a really nice solution to these', '\n\n\n', 'RF diffusion generates diverse and new-to-nature', '\n\n', 'problems', 'and so the first thing that we went for', 'is we just wanted to like see how far we', 'could push unconditional backbone', 'generation and this is just sort of', 'measuring how well could a model when', "it's when it's given a lot of real", 'estate in terms of amino acids how well', 'can it make just protein domains that', 'fold nicely and so as depicted here kind', 'of on the top of this screen', 'as we we can actually get really long', 'proteins that when you encode them with', 'a sequence with protein MPN can be', 'really nicely recapitulated with Alpha', 'fold so you can see the alpha fold in', 'color overlaid on the RF diffusion', 'design model in Gray', 'and we Quantified this kind of on the', 'bottom left plot here showing an alpha', 'fold versus design rmsd as a function of', 'length and you can see that even up to', 'say 400 amino acids', 'the median protein coming out of RF', 'diffusion is exceptionally designable in', 'in the eyes of protein MPN followed by', 'Alpha fold which is really remarkable', 'and then even up to six 600 amino acids', 'sort of in this length range', 'you can still find the occasional', 'backbone that RF diffusion produces and', 'then protein and pnn can successfully', 'get Alpha fold to recapitulate and and', 'getting a high confidence Alpha fold', 'prediction with this low of rmsd and', 'this confidence is is quite a remarkable', 'task I would say', 'so', 'we this this looked really good and so', 'we wanted to kind of Benchmark this', 'against another state-of-the-art method', 'for generating backbones so we chose to', 'Benchmark it against Rosetta fold', 'hallucination', 'and so you can see in both this shorter', 'protein regime but also much more so in', 'the long protein regime on this Alpha', 'fold versus design rmsd Benchmark RF', 'diffusion kind of just', 'um knocks it out out of the park in', 'terms of staying low with with Alpha', 'photo rmsds versus designs', "um and it's it scales much better than", 'Rosetta fold hallucination which was', 'really exciting', "and then one thing that you've kind of", 'always got to make sure of and and', 'verify is that these types of generative', "models they're not just memorizing the", "data set they're actually modeling the", 'whole distribution that you want to', 'model and and so we checked this via the', 'TM score and so for a variety of lengths', 'of proteins sampled from RF diffusion', 'um these are not the alpha folds these', 'are just what RF diffusion was actually', 'trying to build we just measured the TM', 'score a similarity metric versus the', 'entire training set in the pdb and we', 'can see basically across the board that', 'RF diffusion backbones are very', 'they show very little similarity to', 'anything that it was trained on in the', 'pdb which is really really nice so you', 'can look at all of these designs and', 'basically basically all of them are just', '\n\n\n', 'RF diffusion captures the ideality of de novo designec', '\n\n', 'brand new proteins which is really', 'really cool', 'so the next thing we wanted to see was', 'okay can these unconditional proteins', 'actually recapitulate some of the', 'desirable de novo protein properties', 'that Joe mentioned earlier so expressing', 'well being very thermostable folding', 'well and that that sort of thing so we', 'took just these unconditional 300 amino', 'acid designs here on the left and', 'ordered their sequences expressed them', 'in E coli and then looked at at their CD', 'Spectra and tried to melt them and what', 'we found was that they indeed exhibited', 'these really nice properties so they', 'they expressed at really high levels and', 'they were well folded according to CD', 'Spectra and then they were impossible to', 'melt up to Boiling boiling them and uh', 'for perspective if you did see a protein', 'melt in this CD melt Spectra you would', 'see sort of this sigmoidal curve with', 'the inflection point uh denoting where', 'the melting temperature is and we just', "don't see that with these unconditional", '\n\n\n', 'RF diffusion can generate specific protein folds', '\n\n', "designs so they're really nicely behaved", "so that's that's super exciting", 'and then another challenge that we', 'wanted to address is the ability to make', 'scaffold libraries and Sample around a', 'particular fold family this is really', 'useful for for design methods that', 'actually utilize large databases or', 'large libraries of backbones say where', "you're trying to design a small molecule", 'binder or an enzyme and you need to', 'scaffold say a constellation of side', 'chains and and you need a lot of', 'backbones to look through', 'and so the way that we try to tackle', 'this is inputting two pieces of', 'information to the network this block', 'adjacency tensor which describes just', 'very coarse grained or very roughly', 'which secondary structure elements are', 'close to each other in 3D space', 'and then', 'the second piece of information is just', "actually encoding what's the secondary", 'structure of each of each residue and so', 'these are two very easy things to', 'compute and then send into a model so we', 'trained a new version of the model that', 'then could condition its predictions its', 'predictions of X naught hat on these', 'pieces of information and specifically', 'we input that in this 2D template track', 'for Rosetta fold to condition on', 'and so when when we do this this is just', 'an example of a trajectory uh that comes', 'out when you allow the network to', 'condition on the family of of uh folds', 'from Tim barrels you can see a nice uh', 'iterative trajectory that that', '\n\n\n', 'RF diffusion robustly designs specific protein folds', '\n\n', 'recapitulates the Tim Barrel fold by I', "at least and then here's just some more", 'examples so starting from this really', 'perfect looking Tim Barrel we designed a', "few a few more and importantly what's", "what's cool I think is that you're", 'sampling all different sort of of', 'confirmations and flexing of this this', 'backbone and and', 'sampling the whole distribution of Tim', 'Barrel folds presumably', 'and when we ordered these sequences', 'tested them again they expressed really', "nicely they folded up and they didn't", 'melt and so that was just really nice to', 'see that we could do this for a', 'particular fold family', "and we're not obviously limited to just", 'the Tim Barrel family we we tried this', 'with ntf2s and this this is just a', 'really nice', 'um Benchmark results from alpha fold for', 'these for these different ntf2 designs', 'and what we saw for both the 10 barrels', 'and the ntf2s and presumably other', "problems we're trying to sample a", 'particular fold family with these', 'adjacency and secondary structure', 'tensors is that the rate of designs', 'coming out of our diffusion that meet', 'sort of orderable criteria this', 'in-silico success rate that we would', 'consider an orderable protein is', 'somewhere on the order of 40 to 50', "percent and so that's just an extremely", 'efficient way to generate new samples', '\n\n\n', 'Explicit design of symmetric oligomers', '\n\n', 'from a full family', 'um that was really exciting to see', 'okay so then the next thing we tried is', 'it would be it would be really useful to', 'be able to generate symmetric oligomers', 'for all sorts of materials design', 'problems vaccine design problems', 'and so the way that we approach approach', 'this is taking the point Cloud that you', 'you send into Rosetta fold each time on', 'off diffusion each time take an', "asymmetric unit's worth of the residues", 'from that gaussian distribution and then', 'apply all of the Symmetry operators from', 'whatever your point symmetry is that', "you're trying to generate proteins for", 'and so when you do this the equivalence', 'of the network will actually make it so', 'that X naught hat the prediction is also', 'really really closely respecting this', 'point Symmetry and then after your', 'prediction and then you interpolate', 'towards it you get your next set of of', 'residues a little less noisy then you', 're-symmetrize that again and repeat this', 'process all the way until the final time', 'step', "and then what's really nice is that by", 'definition after this trajectory has', 'been run you will have a fold a protein', 'that perfectly respects your point', 'Symmetry and then you can just use any', 'sequence design method you want say', 'protein MPN to symmetrically design the', 'sequence for this oligomer and this is', 'kind of advantageous', 'um Beyond previously known deep learning',
