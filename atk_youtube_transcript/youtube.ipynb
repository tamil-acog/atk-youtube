      "<p>Points between Cohere and OpenAI in terms of embedding models. Okay, so we're going to first take a look at the costs between these two opening eyes. So, Premiere embedding model right now is auto 002 comes out to this much per 1000 tokens. Cohere doesn't have a like per 1000 tokens for the cost, it actually goes with one dollar per 1000 embeddings. What does one embedding mean? Well, basically every call or every chunk of text that you ask out here to embed that is one embedding. So, upon embedding the maximum size of that is actually just over four thousand tokens. So, if you're maxing out every embedding is in you are sending 4 000 tokens to every embedding call then that means you would be getting this comparable price here which is actually half price which is pretty good. Now, if we kind of translate this into something that's a bit more understandable we have like 13 paragraphs is roughly about a thousand tokens these are the prices all right. So, with order with OpenAI it's one dollar per thirty two and a half thousand pairs so here is actually one dollar per 65 000 paragraphs which is really good but there is obviously a catch which is you know this thing up here or this one dollar per 1000 embeddings right the chances are you're probably not going to use four thousand embeddings with every call to Cohere so 2000 tokens well that's probably like 26 paragraphs if you're embedding 26 paragraphs at a time realistically you're probably gonna do much less right. So, if let's say you're going for more like a thousand tokens which I think is more realistic then obviously the price of go here is actually double the price of OpenAI in this instance so it kind of depends on what you're doing there as to whether you are throwing a load of text into your embeddings or not so I think the costs are pretty comparable Cohere can be cheaper but it can also be more expensive according to this logic anyway.</p>\n",

      "<p>Of course, you can create embeddings for longer terms of text, okay? And this is the data that we're going to be using. It's some straight data from Wikipedia that Nils put together, I believe, and just hosted under coher on I can face datasets. So let's have a look at these. For now, we're just going to look at the English and Italian, and we're going to see how we would put those and create a search with them. And then what I'm going to do is switch across to an example where we have way more data in the database, and that covers, I think, nine languages, but it's pretty interesting. So this is what day looks like. We just have like some text in the middle that's what we're going to be encoding, right? So if we're embedding these chunks one at a time, maybe it would be more expensive using cohere, but I think in reality, we could put a lot more of these together. So we could put together like five of these chunks or more, and it should work pretty well. So okay, let's go down here. You need a go here API key. So to get that, you would go to here. So you type in dashboard dot coher.ai, okay? And you'll probably have to log in if you haven't already logged in to go here. And then you go over to the left here, and you will find some API keys. From there, you take your API key, and you just put it in here. Okay, I have my API key stored already in a variable called cohere API key. Cool. Then this is how you would embed something, right? So we have a list of text that we would like to embed, and we just pass them to this Co dot embed. So Co is just a client that we've initialized up here. So co.embed text, and then you have your model. This is the only multilingual model that cohere offers at the moment, but I mean, like, if you compare that to open AI right now, they just offer English models. So I think they've taken the lead with that, which is pretty cool. Pull embeddings from response. So okay, we create our embedding six gives us like response, and it has a lot of information in there, but all we need are the embeddings, right? So we're just starting those out, and obviously, dimensionality of those embeddings, which is going to be 768. So that's the dimensionality, and then we have two of those Vector embeddings there, right? So we have two 768 dimensional vectors because we have two sentences. All right, now that's how we would use coheres embedding model, but before we move on to actually creating.</p>\n"

      "<p>200,000 and 100. Now, with the embedding model and Vector index, we can move on to actually indexing everything. So basically, we're just going to loop through our dataset and we're going to do what we just did. So we're going to embed things with coherent and then what we're going to do is with those embeddings, we're going to add them into Pyco. Right, actually, I don't think I showed you how we do that, but it's really simple. It's actually just this line here, but let me explain what we have here. So batch size is the number of items that we're going to send to go here and then upset into Pinecone at any one time. The Lang limit, so this is a number of records from each language that we would like to include that would like to embed and add to Pine Cone. We have our data here, so I'm just formatting this so that it's a bit easier later on when we get to this bit here and errors. And this is just so we can store a few errors because every now and again, we might hit one, and I'll explain why it's not necessary, but there are ways to avoid it basically that I'm not that hard, but for simplicity's sake, I haven't included them in here. So here, I'm just saying, you know, don't go over the Lang limit, and then we're going through English and Italian one at a time. We get a relevant batch from our data, which we've created here. So it's actually just see the iterable of the data first English and Italian. We extract text from that. We create our embeddings using that text. Then we just create some IDs. This is just an ID variable that was in the data up at the top here, ID, and also including text in there as well, okay? And then what we do is we create this metadata list of dictionaries. Now, each dictionary is going to contain some text, a title from the record, the URL of the record, and also the language, so English or Italian. And then what we do is we add everything like this, okay? So it's pretty straightforward. There's nothing too complicated going on there. The one thing is that I have added in there is occasionally, so you know, we saw those the text earlier on. It was, you know, they were pretty short Trump's attacks, but for some reason, not all of them are like this. It's kind of like a messy dataset. So some of them are actually quite long, and they actually exceed the metadata limit in Pinecone, which is 10 kilobytes per Vector. So basically, we can add up to around 10 kilobytes of text with per Vector in Pinecone, but some of them go over that, and they will throw an error. So I'm actually, for now, I'm just skipping those, but in reality, what you do is you chunk those larger chunks of text into smaller chunks and then just add them individually or just saw your text somewhere else. It doesn't have to go into Pine again. Right now, I've already run this. I'm not going to run it again, and yeah, I can just come down to here. I can run this. We have our describe index.</p>\n"

      "<p>So, I hope this is correct. It's apparently this person. Okay, so that's it for this introduction to Cohere. I feel like it was a bit longer than I had intended it to be, but that's fine. I'm hoping that it was at least useful, and we went through a lot of things there. So, yeah, I just wanted to share this. It's an alternative to OpenAI. I'm not saying it's necessarily better. I'm not saying it's necessarily cheaper. I think that is very much going to depend on your use case, what you're doing, and many other factors, right? You can train these models. For example, if you're able to train them, then you know you're probably going to get some pretty good performance as well. And I suppose like one big factor here is actually the multilingual aspect of this model. At the moment, OpenAI doesn't have any multilingual models or not they're actually trained to do that. Some of them, I think, can handle multilingual queries relatively well, but then they haven't been trained for that, and you know this can be relatively problematic, you know, especially when you're dealing with multinational companies or just companies that are not American or English or Australian as well. I'm not gonna forget you, any in the rest of the world speaks different languages, so having this multilingual model is pretty good. So, yeah, I mean, this is still very early days for Cohere. I'm pretty excited. I know they have a lot planned, and that'll be really interesting to see, but for now, I think we'll leave it there. I hope all this has been useful and interesting, so thank you very much for watching, and I will see you again in the next one. Bye.</p>\n"
